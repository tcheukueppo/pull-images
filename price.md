# GET POSSIBLE PRICES OF AN ARTICLE FROM A SET OF WEB PAGES

## TECHNIQUE

1. Iterate over tags having contents and try to match each content with a regular expression
describing the price in your unit of interest(xaf, euro, dollar, ... etc.).

```
(?<i> (?&FLOAT) ) (?<u> (?&UNITS) )?
(?&PAD) (?<r> (?&RANGE) ) (?&PAD)
(?(<r>)
  (?<ii> (?&FLOAT) )?
  (?(<ii>)
     (?<u> (?&UNITS) )?
  )
)
(?(DEFINE)
  (?<FLOAT> \d+ (?: [.,] \d+ )? )
  (?<PAD> \s* )
  (?<RANGE> [-] )

  (?<DOLLAR> $ | &dollar; | (?i: dollar(?:s)? ) )
  (?<EURO> â‚¬ | &euro; | (?i: euro(?:s)? ) )
  # define units here ...

  (?<UNITS>
       (?&DOLLAR) 
     | (?&EURO)
     # more units ...
  )
)
```

2. For a given marked tag, if this defined regex matches a substring of its content, then attempt to
locate the most closest targeting article name by executing **in order** the following
steps. If you succeed in either one of them then don't follow the next steps.

- Check the content of the tag itself to see if the name of your targeting article exists(Naive?).

If exists then we fill in the record for this price:

* The extracted article name in the tag's content.
* The precision of the extracted article name.
* The distance between the tag and matched price which is zero in this case.

- Without crossing marked tag, check content of each of its upper siblings from the closest
to the farthest one and if you found your targeting article name, then stop there
and fill in the record for this price.

* The extracted article name in the content.
* The precision of the extracted article name.
* The distance between the extracted article and the 

- Well, if you arrived here then that means the page might be that of an ecomerce
website, do the following.
